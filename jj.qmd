###X-axis shows sepal length, Y-axis shows sepal width, and colors represent the three iris species.

#Clearly reveals how the species differ in sepal size and shape.

#Shows the distribution of sepal length for each species, including median, interquartile range and potential outliers.

#Helps compare central tendency and spread of sepal length across the three species.
